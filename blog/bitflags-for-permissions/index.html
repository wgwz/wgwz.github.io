  <h2>Bitflags for permissions</h2>
  <div>by Kyle Lawlor-Bagcal</div>
  <div>Tuesday, February 16, 2021<div>
  <div><p>Recently I revisited a way to deal with permissions in an application.
Miguel Grinberg's Flask Web Development book presented a way to do this
with so-called "bit flags". I did not fully understand how this was
implemented until last night. It's quite a clever way of dealing with
permissions in an application. In order for me to understand how this
works I needed to look more into "bit flags". So this post will cover my
understanding of this interesting data structure.</p>
<p>Before going further I'm just going to emphasize that my understanding
really hinges on two data sources. First being the Flask book and the
second being this article from a Nasa site. But before I dive into the
details let's just talk about the high-level concepts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Roles: a set of permissions defines a role for a user in an
application</li>
<li>Permissions: an individual marker identifying that a user can do
something in application.</li>
</ol>
<p>It probably seems weird to go into defining these things because we
are all so intimately familiar with the concept of roles and
permissions. They exist in nearly every application that we use on
regular basis. But I still find it helpful to keep in mind that a role
for a user in an application is comprised of many permissions. Discord
is a great example of an application that is highly configurable through
custom roles.</p>
<p>So how can we represent a users permissions in our application? The
upshot is that with "bit flags" you can uniquely represent the users
role with a single integer value. But let's think about this a little
bit. Let's say that we define some permissions like so:</p>
<pre><code>COMMENT = 1
WRITE   = 2
EDIT    = 3
ADMIN   = 4
SUPER   = 5
</code></pre>
<p>Awesome, we've defined 5 permissions in our application. And each one of
them has an integer value assigned to it. Now we have to think about
roles. How could we represent a "standard" user role in our application?
Let's say that a standard user role allows commenting, writing and
editing.  There are a couple ways to think about that users role:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the values together. <code>COMMENT + WRITE + EDIT = 6</code>. Therefore this
standard user role is represented by the value 6. This is what I said
we could do earlier, we could represent all permissions in the
application as a single integer value. (But this has issues)</li>
<li>Store a list of the permissions that the user has, <code>[1,2,3]</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>How do we reverse this though? What if we needed to figure out which
permissions a user has? The addition method has a glaring problem. There
is more than one way to add the permissions such that the end result is
<code>6</code>. I.e. <code>COMMENT + SUPER = 6</code> and <code>WRITE + ADMIN = 6</code>. So simple
addition looks like it's out (but we will find later all hope is not
lost).</p>
<p>With the list of permissions approach we can at least uniquely identify
the roles that user has, but it has a different problem. For every
standard user we need to store at least 3 values. It could be up to 5
values if the person is also an <code>ADMIN</code> and a <code>SUPER</code>.  Add even more if
your application allows more, i.e. Discord and Jira.  Everywhere you
need to pass the info about your users role, you would need to send
these 3 values. And in application that has a lot of users that can
become burdensome.</p>
<p>How can this be done better? This is where bit flags and bitwise
operators come in. Let's change up the underlying representation of our
permissions and dive into this approach:</p>
<pre><code>COMMENT = 0b00000001 (binary) = 1
WRITE   = 0b00000010          = 2
EDIT    = 0b00000100          = 4
ADMIN   = 0b00001000          = 8
SUPER   = 0b10000000          = 128
</code></pre>
<p>What's different? Well we chose to represent the permissions in binary.
In other words, each permission is a power of 2. This has the solves the
issue with adding the values of the roles. Therefor each sum of the
permissions will end up unique. I.e. our standard role `COMMENT + WRITE</p>
<ul>
<li>EDIT = 7`.</li>
</ul>
<p>So great, we've solved that issue. We can now store a single integer in
our database for every user of our application, and it will uniquely
represent the persons role. But we need to be able to check this persons
role to customize their experience in our application. How can we do
that? It turns out that we can actually get some more utility out of
using binary numbers to represent roles. We can use <em>bitwise</em> operators
as well.</p>
<p>The upshot here is that bitwise operations are <em>very</em> efficient
operations computationally, they are also built-in to the foundation
every programming language. Here's an example in Elixir of how we can
combine the permissions for our standard user role:</p>
<pre><code>use Bitwise
comment = 0b00000001
write = 0b00000010
edit = 0b00000100
standard_user = comment ||| write ||| edit
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>|||</code> is called the bitwise OR operator, this is the particular
symbol that Elixir uses for "bitwise OR". It will be different in every
language. We can read this literally as the standard user can comment or
write or edit.</p>
<p>Now imagine that a standard user is going to edit a post that they
created on our site. How would our application check that this person is
allowed to do that?</p>
<pre><code>iex(20)&gt; standard_user &amp;&amp;&amp; edit
4
</code></pre>
<p>What if the user is trying to access an admin-only dashboard?</p>
<pre><code>iex(21)&gt; standard_user &amp;&amp;&amp; admin
0
</code></pre>
<p>What if the user is trying to do super-only action?</p>
<pre><code>iex(22)&gt; standard_user &amp;&amp;&amp; super
0
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>&amp;&amp;&amp;</code> operator is the bitwise AND operator for Elixir. What you can
see from the outputs above is that if a user has the permission we are
testing, it returns the integer value of that permission. If a user does
not have the permission we get back <code>0</code>. This gives a very efficient and
convenient method of checking if a user is authorized for a given task
in an application.</p>
<p>It's worth revisiting the list of permissions we discussed earlier, and
comparing the approach for how we would check a users permissions in
that scenario. First and foremost we would need to create a list in
memory:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; roles = [1, 2, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>Then we would need to check if the required role for a given action in
the application is contained in that list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; admin in [1, 2, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>To me this doesn't seem too much worse. I suppose a downside is that if
your application grows and you need to add more permissions, you will
need to adjust your database model to have a new column. Otherwise you
might be able to make use of JSON column type, and store the list
directly. Either scenario seems more complex than using the binary
representation which involves storing a single integer value in your
database. The point is that using a list has more tradeoffs than just
performance and memory optimizations, some of which I probably have not
even considered.</p>
<p>My next goals are to incorporate this into a database model, and see how
to develop a model within Elixir and Phoenix that makes use of this type
of a permissions scheme. I am not an expert on this method of
permissions. I am merely reflecting what I have learned from these
resources, which I recommend checking out:</p>
