  <h2>Exercism golang track with delve debugger</h2>
  <div>by Kyle Lawlor-Bagcal</div>

  <div><p>Recently I have been curious about exploring golang. I want to carry over some
of the habits I've developed in Python. So I got curious to know what the
debugging experience is like for golang. I haven't really worked with debugging
a compiled language before.</p>
<p>Go's official docs have a page dedicated to debugging with gdb. But they
basically give a pretty loud disclaimer that you should not use it unless you
really have to. Luckily they give a recommendation for a debugger that you can
use called "delve".</p>
<p>The installation instructions are pretty straightforward assuming you've got
some experience with the basics of using go. I was pleasantly surprised by how
easy it was to get up and running with delve, in conjunction with a pretty
common structure for code.</p>
<p>Exercism is great because it gives you a module and test module no matter what
language you're using. This is often not too far off from how I actually
develop. Running the tests for exercism is done with this automagic command
(assuming your in your exercism exercise directory):</p>
<pre><code>$ ~/go/bin/dlv test
Type 'help' for list of commands.
(dlv)
</code></pre>
<p>You're now dropped into a <code>dlv</code> prompt. <code>help</code> shows you a bunch of commands.
You can set a breakpoint or few by saying <code>b</code> followed by the name of the
function you want to break on. You've got tools for looking at local variables,
and evaluating code. You can use <code>c</code> to continue as with pdb and <code>n</code> to
evaluate only to the next line of code.</p>
<p>Another interesting command is <code>rebuild</code>. You can make changes to your source
code or tests, and rebuild within the <code>dlv</code> prompt. And then you can
effectively re-run all your tests, with updated source code.</p>
<p>This seems like a fantastic tool and I look forward to exploring it some more:</p>
