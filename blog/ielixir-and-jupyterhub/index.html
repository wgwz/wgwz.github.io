  <h2>IElixir and Jupyter Lab</h2>

  <div><p>I really enjoy working in Jupyter Lab for taking markdown notes as I am reading or
throwing together short little code snippets as I am learning something new. As such when
I am learning a new language, such as Elixir I often want to reach out for a similar tool.
A few months ago I came across this article and now I've finally set up a working IElixir
kernel to use.</p>
<p>What this gets me is an environment where I can write snippets of Elixir code, just like I
would for prototyping with Python. That said, the setup I will be writing about here is
very simplistic. I'm sure many others have taken Python set ups in Jupyter lab much
farther than I have. In any case this post will share the few steps you need to get
IElixir running and connected to Jupyter lab. If you haven't [installed jupyter lab][6]
that should be as simple as doing:</p>
<p><code>bash $ pip install --user jupyterlab</code></p>
<p>The first step will be getting [IElixir][1] installed, the official instructions can be
[found here][3]. This of course assumes you have [Elixir installed][4] on your system.
Another dependency that I needed to install for IElixir was <code>zeromq-devel</code> which you can
get in your package manager or [follow here][5]. Once you've got IElixir and Jupyterlab
installed, there are two steps left:</p>
<p>Start up the IElixir kernel process and leave that running: <code>$ ~/.local/bin/jupyter
kernel --kernel=ielixir [KernelApp] Starting kernel 'ielixir' [KernelApp] Connection file:
/home/wgwz/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/kernel-39b05ef7-4c4f-4b23-8b71-21d1306ef9d6.json
[KernelApp] To connect a client: --existing
kernel-39b05ef7-4c4f-4b23-8b71-21d1306ef9d6.json</code></p>
<p>Start up jupyter lab as usual:</p>
<p><code>$ jupyter lab</code></p>
<p>Then when you open up the launcher window in Jupyter lab you we will see an option for
Elixir. You'll be able to open up a terminal or a notebook, just the same as you would
with Python. And profit!</p>
