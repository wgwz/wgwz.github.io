  <h2>srht and ghpages</h2>
  <div>by Kyle Lawlor</div>
  <div>Wednesday, November 27, 2019<div>
  <div><p>Lately I have been not excited about maintaining my site or adding new
content to it. That was mainly because of the fact that maintaining
domain names for my personal site is not something I want to do. The
same goes for SSL certificates although I do have a pretty convenient
system for updating them using the EFF's <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I want to be able to focus on my sites content over anything
else.</p>
<p>This post will be covering the new setup I have in place. There are a
few components in the way my site is now deployed.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sourcehut.org/">Sourcehut</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a></li>
</ol>
<p>All three of these components are interesting technologies in and of
themselves but #2 is the one I will focus on the most in this post. It
should be noted that #3 also made this setup much easier, as it contains
a toolset meant for integrating to #1.</p>
<pre><code>        +----------------------+
Step 6. |https://wgwz.github.io|
        +----------------------+
Step 5. |ghpages               |
        +----------------------+
Step 4. |https://builds.sr.ht  |
        +-------------------------------+
Step 3. |https://git.sr.ht/~wgwz/my-site|
        +----------------------+--------+
Step 2. |git commit &amp;&amp; git push|
        +-------------+--------+
Step 1. |edit my-site/|
        +-------------+
</code></pre>
<p>The interesting stuff happens between steps 3, 4 and 5. The git
repository contains a ".build.yml" file:</p>
<pre><code>image: alpine/edge
secrets:
  - 1c7823a9-63c2-432e-adca-39371c08e665
  - 47845823-510e-4d5b-8016-544743c51470
packages:
  - python3-dev
  - libffi-dev
  - openssl-dev
sources:
  - git@git.sr.ht:~wgwz/my-site
tasks:
  - check-branch: | 
      cd my-site 
      if [ "$(git rev-parse master)" != "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" ]; then \
        complete-build; \
      fi
  - setup: |
      cd my-site
      pip3 install --user lektor
  - build: |
      cd my-site
      ~/.local/bin/lektor build
  - deploy: |
      cd my-site
      ~/.local/bin/lektor deploy --username=wgwz --password=$(cat ~/.gh_personal_access_token) ghpages
shell: false
</code></pre>
<p>Often times when I see configuration files like this I get quite nervous
in the sense that I wonder how the file was created. Testing these files
can be quite difficult. I want to emphasize that experience creating
this file was quite pleasant. It's something you should just go and try
for yourself on sourcehut. Basically you are given a simple text box and
you can start from scratch and build up precisely the file you need.
Furthermore you can ssh into a live instance of your build at each
iteration. This is extremely helpful as you can take a look at what is
going on in the file system at every step of the way. Another thing that
I really appreciated was that there were very few quirks to the way that
the container was structured in terms filesystem layouts and other linux
stuff.</p>
<p>So with a bit of fancy footwork on the sourcehut side of things I can
install my static site manager "lektor", store some secrets like
ssh-keys or github access tokens and set up tasks that execute regular
commands. Figuring out how to use secrets on sourcehut was quite
straightforward as well. But something that I definitely will need to
verify I am doing correctly and securely. I'm also certain that the way
I am cat-ing my github personal access token in the build file is a bad
practice.</p>
<p>At the end of the day my workflow for publishing new content on my
website is to make edits locally, commit my changes locally and push
them to my version control system. After that a build process gets fired
off and within a few minutes my static site management tool "lektor" has
force pushed updates to my ghpages using a personal access token.</p>
<p>Type, commit and push. Feels like a cool breeze on a hot day. :-)</p>
