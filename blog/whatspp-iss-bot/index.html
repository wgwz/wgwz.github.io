  <h2>WhatsApp ISS Bot</h2>
  <div>by Kyle Lawlor-Bagcal</div>
  <div>Friday, September 4, 2020<div>
  <div><p>So I have been working on a WhatsApp bot for an article that I'm in
process of writing. I've been slacking hard on the article, but it's
been a great learning opportunity. I've finally figured out a way to
deploy the bot, using some fancy tech on AWS. Perhaps I'll add more
details about that later.</p>
<p>For now I just wanted a place to publish some information about the
bot. So here are the instructions to make use of it!</p>
<ol>
<li>From WhatsApp, send the following code to +14155238886, "join nodded-pile".</li>
<li>Send any message to the bot once you've joined successfully.</li>
<li>You'll get some instructions from the bot sent back to you.</li>
</ol>
<p>What the heck does the bot do???!!</p>
<p>When you send the bot your location from WhatsApp, the bot reaches out
to various APIs, and does it's best to calculate the several times that
the International Space Station will be visible from your location. It
doesn't take into account weather conditions yet, but it does take into
the time the sun will setting at your location.</p>
<p>The bot will give you additional info about how to look for the ISS as
well. But there is room for improvement. It turns out the calculating the
precise compass direction and angle of elevation that the ISS will be flying
by at is fairly tricky! Maybe a future version of the bot will do this
better.</p>
