  <h2>Kyle Lawlor-Bagcal</h2>
  <div class='page-body'><p>Hi, welcome to my personal site. I occasionally write some things in my blog (see the tab above). I expect it to be mostly programming, science and education related topics. Occasionally I may write about random side-projects.</p>
<p>I'm a former physicist who greatly enjoys solving problems. As such I've decided to pursue a career in software development. I've discovered an equally rich world of ideas and consider studying computer science more formally in the future. That said I do buy into the idea of software development having "craftsmanship". As such I am constantly looking for better ways of doing things and try to question everything (I said I was a scientist right?). At the same time I greatly value the humanities and strive to expand my knowledge in those areas as well. In my opinion tech and science without the humanities is simply lost.</p>
<p>I hope you find something you enjoy here and I will do my best to provide interesting stuff.</p>
