  <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
  <div class='page-body'><h4>Application Development Lead</h4>
<blockquote><p><em>Teachers College Information Technology at Columbia University</em></p>
<p><em>May 2020 - Present</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>More to come..</p>
<h4>Application Systems Developer</h4>
<blockquote><p><em>Columbia University Information Technology</em></p>
<p><em>August 2017 - May 2020</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this role I am essentially working as a full-stack developer. I maintain and create web applications that are student, teacher and admin facing at the university. Some of these applications are integrated with the Canvas LMS which is one of the primary service offerings for group I am working in.</p>
<p>My group are also the service owners of many other third-party systems. As such we have numerous incoming and outgoing data pipelines which require development and maintenance. In example the Canvas LMS requires all user and enrollment information from Student Information Systems and Identity and Access management teams.</p>
<p>I lead my team in pursuing best practices in software development such as testing and code reviews. I find that both of these practices are essential to writing quality and maintainable code. I seek to tame complexity and I am constantly sharpening my skill-set for doing so, as well as challenging my teammates in both technical and non-technical roles to do the same.</p>
<h4>Backend Developer</h4>
<blockquote><p><em>Pluvio Inc.</em>, Brooklyn, NY.</p>
<p><em>September 2016 - February 2017</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Python and Flask-based JSON API for an iOS Application</li>
<li>Developed with Neo4j graph database</li>
<li>Built a continuous-integration and testing pipeline for the API web service using Heroku</li>
<li>Containerized the entire back-end application using docker-compose which allowed easier local development and testing</li>
<li>Learned and introduced testing into the code-base, many lessons learned.</li>
</ul>
